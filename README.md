Array Processing in Java

## Overview
An exhibit is a rundown of information. Having a variety of a data is conceivable. Each piece of information in an exhibit is recognized by a file number addressing its situation in the cluster. The principal component in the exhibit is [0], the subsequent component is [1], etc. Clusters are like articles, so they should be made with the watchword new.

Each exhibit has a variable length, which is a number incentive for the all out number of components in the cluster. Note that since record numbering starts at nothing (not 1), the last worth in that frame of mind with a length of 5 ought to be referred to as array[4] (that is, the length less 1), not array[5], which would set off a mistake.

One more typical wellspring of disarray is the distinction between utilizing length to get the size of an exhibit and length() to get the size of a String. Notice the presence of brackets while working with Strings. (array.length is a variable, while String.length() is a strategy well defined for the String class.)
